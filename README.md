# Minor-Project-
The backbone of UPES Guidance System is A* algorithm for finding the shortest path between 
source and destination. The A star algorithm is admissible due to the heuristic function in the algorithm. A star algorithm is a single source shortest path finding algorithm that is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. Also, A star algorithm achieves better results due to its heuristic functionality.

## This project is implemented on pygame to showcase the gui and how A* is implemented on UPES COLLEGE MAP so that one can reach from one destination to another in the shortest path inside college to save time


## The person has to choose the starting and end position where he/she wants to go by putting the grid values  given inside the code on tkinter and cick on submit after that one start and end position will appear at the interface and finally press Enter  button inorder to fully exectute the program and the A* star will show the shortest path from point A to point B.
